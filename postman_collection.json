These principles underscore the policy's commitment to ethical, efficient, and effective procurement practices.\\n\\nIt's also important to note that while the MAV Procurement is not obliged to comply with the Local Government Act 2020, this policy has been developed recognizing sections 108 & 109 of the Act to align with its requirements where applicable.
